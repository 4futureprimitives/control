### A. VISUAL POLITICS Template
The following project template exists as as a forum of experimentation for this semester's course exercises. Some of the pages are written in html, though others are meant to introduce a variety of visual languages. For instance: 

1. **p5.js**: We can use the [p5](https://p5js.org/) Javascript library to animate basic political ideas in creative compositions of text and image.

2. **Chart.js**: Maps, graphs, and the representation of the world is a significant (yet often ignored) component of the politics. I'll touch briefly upon the Chart.js library as an example of working at the intersection of the quantitative and teh visual. Chart.js was beyond [Toyo Keizei's daily Covid-19 updates](https://toyokeizai.net/sp/visual/tko/covid19/en.html), which provided one of the best bilingual resources in Japan.
